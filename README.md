# 🛑 Fake Job Posting Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
Fake job postings are a growing concern for job seekers. This project aims to **detect fraudulent job listings** using **machine learning algorithms** and **data analysis** to help users identify potential scams.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **ML Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM
- **Data Processing:** Feature Engineering, Data Cleaning, Tokenization
- **Notebook Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains **real and fake job postings**, including fields like job title, location, company profile, description, and fraudulent status.
- Data Source: [(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction)]

## 📊 Features Implemented
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming job descriptions.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying trends and patterns in fake job postings.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from job descriptions and metadata.
- **Model Training:** Implementing and comparing multiple ML models.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Implement **Deep Learning models** (LSTMs, Transformers) for better accuracy.
- Deploy the model using a **Flask or FastAPI backend**.
- Build a **real-time job posting validator**.
